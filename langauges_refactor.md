Recommended Next Steps üìù
Complete the Refactoring:

Review and update lobby.ts, playerProfile.ts, Online.ts, and Game.ts
Replace all hardcoded strings with getText('key')

Standardize the Approach:

Update any instances of direct STRINGS[lang].key access to use getText('key') instead
This ensures language changes are applied consistently
Test Language Switching:

Test the language selector on various pages to ensure it works as expected
Verify that all UI elements update properly when changing languages
Add Language Persistence:

Ensure the user's language preference is saved and loaded correctly between sessions
Consider Adding Language Detection:

Optionally, detect the user's browser language for first-time visitors
